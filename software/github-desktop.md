# GitHub Desktop

Annoyingly, GitHub don't provide an installer for Linux, only for Windows and Mac!

Register a Debian/Ubuntu repo for it using the `@shiftkey`or `@mwt` script [here](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop#debianubuntu),
then run this to install it:
```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install github-desktop
```

# Configuration

## Options

### Advanced
Untick "Usage" [] bla

## Accounts
Sign in with Github.com webpage, and ensure that the browse does have excessive security present, so that it works!
I prefer the mobile GitHub App for 2FA.
