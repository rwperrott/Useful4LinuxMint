More CPU intensive than VNC, maybe RDP, but just-works across multiple OS.
- Server was easy to get working on Linux, unlike VNC and RDP.
- A working android client exists, but is less powerful than desktop OS clients, has some bugs.
- Feature rich; possibly better than RDP, e.g.!
    - Servers advertise on LAN, so less connection setup needed.
    - The ability to mount client directories on a target machine.
    - The ability to mount target directories on a client machine.
- Cons
    - Server and target server configuration could be better.
