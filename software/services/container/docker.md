# [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

- The Docker's container host service runs as a system service, which may not be a good idea, and Podman maybe better/safer! 
- Kubernetes maybe better than `Docker Compose`!

## [Docker Desktop](/software/desktop/docker-desktop.md)

- This is an easy entry point for docker deployment, but has issues.
- Has Docker CLI tool bundled with it.
- This is **unnecessary** for docker image use, and maybe sneaky bait to use Docker services!
- Probably not an appropriate tool for live deployments.

## Docker Hub

- Docker Hub is the world's easiest way to create, manage, and deliver your team's container applications.

- [Docs](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/)
- [Hub Website](https://hub.docker.com/)

- The `docker` CLI tool automatically uses `Docker Hub` as it's default Docker image repository,
but can be told to use others, like AWS provide.  

## Docker CLI tool
**TODO: create /software/docker.md for the docker CLI tool(s), and link to it here.**
