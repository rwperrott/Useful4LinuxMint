# AppImage application

- An application packaging method, which bundles an application, and its dependencies as a mountable image.
- When run, a FUSE mount is created to expose the application and its dependencies.
- Generally much more compact than [Flatpak](flatpak.md)
- Can be run like a normal **/bin file, unlike damned [Flatpak](flatpak.md) applications.
