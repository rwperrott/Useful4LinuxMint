# Flatpak

- Packages an application to provide Linux distribution portability!
- The applications all run in separate sandboxes, with separate permissions.

- I hate this format:
  - Because of the versioned dependence bloat.
  - Desktop icons can disappear from the MATE panel menu!
  - It can't be run directly
  - The MATE panel menu uninstall doesn't work! 

- I prefer AppImage packaging to this.
