## Useful keybindings
- F5 Copy
  - **Beware**, not to assume that this refreshes a tab, like it does in other file manager.
  - A tab refresh is requested via a right-click menu entry.
- F6 Move
- F8 Delete

## Notes

- I uninstalled the `qt5` (dated!) build, and installed the `gtk2` (dated!) build, because some dialogs in the didn't render correctly in the `QT5` build one, making it unusable.
- I moved to the `gtk2` (dated!) version, because it fully works.
- Best to install via apt, not AppImage, because of recent enough versions on current Linux Mint version!
- Surprisingly powerful, â€¦ once you get used to it.
- It actually remembers the open tabs properly on the next open, unlike Xfce's Thunar!

# Cons
- No hand-holding for the sometimes confusing configuration!:
  - One confusing oddity was that he rename command is actually a move command!
  - Adding new buttons was a learning curve, because of no icon name palette, and not opening the directory for an icon where icons are normally stored.
  - Reading the online documentation is necessary for the internal commands.
  - Adding favourite tabs was needlessly hard, and should allow editing of each tab, not full-overwrite to update!
- If transferring a file(s) to/from a busy CIFS/Samba server, attempts to change directory or get meta-data will be blocked until the server gets a chance to respond, making it seem like the tab is locked.
  - A workaround of mine was to pause such transfers, to free up the server to respond.
