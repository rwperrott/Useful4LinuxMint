# Useful4LinuxMint - Software - Firefox Extensions

Yes, I know Mozilla can be nuts and Google is trying to dominate with Chrome, but Firefox is still superior to Chrome for some tasks, and Brave has issues too!
The Tor Project has stuck with an adapted Mozilla Firefox, for good reason.

- TODO: many more to review and maybe add.

## [DownThemAll!](https://www.downthemall.org/)

> DownThemAll is a powerful yet easy-to-use extension that adds new advanced download capabilities to your browser.
>
> DownThemAll lets you download all the links or images on a website and much more: you can refine your downloads by fully customizable filters to get only what you really want.
>
> DownThemAll is all you can desire from a download manager: it allows you to queue, pause and resume downloads at any time and is fully integrated in your favorite browser!

- Not just for Firefox, Chrome and Edge too.

## [PassFF](firefox-extensions/passff.md)

Superior to all other password store extensions, because the backend is simple and secure.

## [Print Edit WE](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/print-edit-we/)

> Edit the contents of a web page before printing or saving. Elements in the web page can be edited, formatted, hidden or deleted. Unwanted content, such as adverts and sidebars, can easily be removed.

- Great to trimming bloat off content, before preview printing as a PDF.


## [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)

> Finally, an efficient wide-spectrum content blocker. Easy on CPU and memory.

## [uMatrix](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/umatrix/)

> Point &amp; click to forbid/allow any class of requests made by your browser. Use it to block scripts, iframes, ads, facebook, etc.

Because too many websites take the proverbial, and PiHole can be too crude a blocking too for some domains.
- Selective JavaScript blocking has help me to stop annoying modal panes appearing on some websites.
