**TODO: consider splitting this**

## Deb `.deb`

The native packaging format for Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint Linux distributions.

### Installers

- apt-get (Debian)
- apt (Ubuntu â†’ Mint)
- [nala](/software/console/nala.md)


## [Flatpak](/software/packaging/appimage.md)

Packages an applications with extra files to make cover for OS differences;
often quite bloated compared to proper OS repository installed applications.
**TODO: decide if need a separate file and what links I need; may beed

### Installer/Manager/Runner

- [flatpak](/software/console/flatpak.md)

## [AppImage](/software/packaging/appimage.md)

Packages an applications with extra files to make cover for OS differences, as a disk image, run via a Fuse mount;
often more usable and not as bloated as Flatpak applications.
