# [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)

A privacy focused build of Firefox.

Firefox needs to be made more secure, to need replacing by LibreWolf; annoyingly Linux Mint, at least the MATE flavour, has a dependencies on Firefox, so it can't be uninstalled!

Install using [Main Debian Repository](https://librewolf.net/installation/debian/#main-debian-repository) sources script; password is needed for sudo!
This must be redone after `mintupgrade` to a new Mint version, because `mintupgrade` annoyingly requires deletion of `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/librewolf.sources`, because of this hack.

# Preferences
