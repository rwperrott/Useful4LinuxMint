# [PassFF](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passff/)

Integrates you x2c4 (`pass`) password store into Firefox.

- Needs [passff-host](https://github.com/passff/passff-host) host app installed for specific firefox browser, e.g. `librewolf` in my case.
- Allows selecting the correct password, when an inexact match occurs.

This is my default password store, because the technology is simple and secure, and well proven.
We don't need Hashicorp's Vault on *nux like OS.

I create and edit the logins using [qtpass](../desktop/qtpass.md).

I found jasonm23's gist [pass-gpg-firefox-android.md](https://gist.github.com/jasonm23/22879cb9c9bff739fc0690ee9229da82#file-pass-gpg-firefox-android-md).
Which maybe useful.
