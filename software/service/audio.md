# Audio Services

- These can fail to work because of distro root or /home issues; 
I had annoying issues with both PulseAudio and PipeWire, including no Audio!
- Annoyingly audio may break because of bad audio server configuration stored in /home/{user} files!
- A "JACK output" audio service will only accept audio input at 48000Hz, otherwise no audio!  


- PulseWire replaced PulseAudio, so I doubt that I will add any notes for it.
    - Ubuntu and Mint (22) have finally switched Mint from PulseAudio to PipeWire.
    - It has proper BT headset support, without any hacks needed.
