# [WineGUI](https://github.com/winegui/WineGUI)

At last, a user-friendly Wine graphical interface (mirror from Gitlab).
It is far better than prior attempts to make a GUI for Wine.

These are no software release in the [GitHub](https://github.com/winegui/WineGUI) repository.
Instead, you need to look at the [GitLab](https://gitlab.melroy.org/melroy/winegui) pages,
specifically the [Releases](https://gitlab.melroy.org/melroy/winegui/-/releases) page,
and download and install the latest deb e.g. [WineGUI-v2.5.0.deb](https://winegui.melroy.org/downloads/WineGUI-v2.5.0.deb)
