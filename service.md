## â†’ [Wine](software/wine.md)
Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a compatibility layer
able to run Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems,
such as Linux, macOS, & BSD. Instead of simulating internal Windows logic,
like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls, on-the-fly.
This eliminates the performance and memory penalties of other methods
and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.
