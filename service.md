# Service Software

## → [Audio](software/service/virtualisation.md)
I am only aware of PulseAudio and PipeWire, but their maybe others, 
other extra audio APIs, like ALSA and JACK. 

## → [Remote Control](software/service/remote-control.md)
Network services, which may provide a Web UI, or just a network API, used for "server"
management/monitoring.
These can be useful for desktop/workstation computers too,
e.g. allowing easy shutdown it the desktop shell becomes unusable!

## → [Virtualisation](software/service/virtualisation.md)
Server software, which allows running software in an isolated environment, even different OS,
or different OS applications.
